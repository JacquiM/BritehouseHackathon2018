# BritehouseHackathon2018

## Proposal
### Aim
The aim of this data modelling problem is to test the knowledge of the participating groups surrounding the modelling of data as well as the extraction of valuable information and the visualization of this information. 

### The Problem
This problem may be broken up into multiple sections:
-	Normalising the dataset into a data structure of choice
-	Transforming the dataset in such a way that is efficient for valuable information extraction
-	The extraction of valuable information or insight
-	Being able to develop new insights from the provided information
-	Visualising the information in a meaningful way

This problem does not restrict the participants to the use of tools as this can be done through code (Python, R, C#, etc.), database engine interface (MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio, etc.) or using analysis tools (Power BI, Plotly, etc). Through this, HR will be able to determine which department the participantsâ€™ skills will be more beneficial to.

The provided dataset will be the Global Superstore excel data for the participants to work off of. The contents of the dataset are summarised as follows:
-	There are 51 290 records
-	There are 3 788 unique product names
-	Product names often differ according to packages to sizes and specifications
-	The products are ordered from 165 countries 
-	The dataset spans over a range of 4 years

## Proposed Challenge
The proposed challenges include:
*	Plan approach
    -	Data structure
    -	Psuedo logic of approach
*	Create a subset from the dataset (optional)
*	Creating the appropriate database structure
*	Populate the database
*	Clean database if needed
*	Extract the information that has business value, for example: (select at least one)
    -	Where possible warehouses are located
    -	Which warehouses store the product
    -	Which markets are most influenced by the chosen product
    -	Trends in product orders
    -	Trends in quantity of products ordered
    -	Project/forecast profits
    -	Find ways to reduce costs
    -	Look at price fluctuations over time
    -	Look at sale fluctuations over time
    -	Does order priority have an effect on orders?
*	Visualise the extracted business value
